Description: HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling for Python
 urllib3 supports features left out of urllib and urllib2 libraries.
 .
   - Re-use the same socket connection for multiple requests (HTTPConnectionPool
     and HTTPSConnectionPool) (with optional client-side certificate
     verification).
   - File posting (encode_multipart_formdata).
   - Built-in redirection and retries (optional).
   - Supports gzip and deflate decoding.
   - Thread-safe and sanity-safe.
   - Small and easy to understand codebase perfect for extending and
     building upon.
